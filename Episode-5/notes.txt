Q) What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?
A) In JavaScript modules, named exports allow you to export multiple variables or functions by name, and they must be 
imported using their exact names. Default export allows exporting a single value per module, which can be imported with 
any name. * as export is used during import to bring in all named exports under a single namespace object for grouped access.

Q)What is the importance of config.js file
A) In JavaScript projects, a config.js file is important for centralizing configuration settings like API endpoints, 
feature flags, environment variables, or constants. This makes the codebase easier to manage, more maintainable, and scalable, 
especially across different environments (development, staging, production).

Q)What are React Hooks?
A) React Hooks are special functions that let you use state, lifecycle features, and other React capabilities inside functional 
components without writing class components. They simplify code, improve reusability, and are now the standard way to manage logic 
in React. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, and useRef, making components cleaner and more modern.

Q) Why do we need a useState Hook?
A) The useState Hook is needed in React to allow functional components to have their own reactive state. Before hooks, only 
class components could hold state, but useState enables functional components to store, update, and react to changes in 
data—triggering re-renders when the state updates. It’s essential for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
