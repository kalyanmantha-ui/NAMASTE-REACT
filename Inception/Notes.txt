Q) Difference between a Library and Framework?
A) The main difference between a library and a framework is in the "inversion of control". With a library, 
    you call the library's functions when you need them, putting you in control of the application flow. 
    With a framework, the framework calls your code at specific points, inverting the control and dictating 
    the application's structure and flow. 

Q)What is CDN? Why do we use it?
A) A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together 
    to deliver web content, like images, videos, and web pages, to users quickly and reliably. CDNs achieve 
    this by caching content on servers located closer to users, reducing the distance data needs 
    to travel and minimizing latency. 

Q) Why is React known as React?
A) React is named "React" because of its core functionality: it reacts to changes in data by updating the user 
    interface accordingly. The library is designed to efficiently update the display based on changes in the 
    application's state or props. This reactivity is a key aspect of how React works, allowing for dynamic and 
    responsive user interfaces. 

Q) What is crossorigin in script tag?

Q) What is diference between React and ReactDOM
A) React is the core library for building UI components.
   ReactDOM is used to render those components to the browser’s DOM.   

Q) What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
A) react.development.js includes extra warnings and error messages for debugging. Development build: Helpful during coding, slower, more verbose.
   react.production.js is optimized for performance and is used in live apps. Production build: Smaller, faster, removes all dev-only checks.

Q) What is async and defer?
A) async runs the script as soon as it's downloaded, defer waits until HTML is fully parsed — and preserves order.
